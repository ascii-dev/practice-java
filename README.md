# Java Algorithms & Data Structures Practice

This repository holds code which relates to my study of data structures and algorithms using 
the Java programming language. I used a couple of resources which I list in its own section
below. It's a work in progress as I continually learn more, both about the algorithms and data 
I already know and ones which I don't know about yet.

# Running Project

This project supports Maven. You can easily run the tests with the command:

```shell script
mvn clean test
```

# Resources

I make use of the following resources (will add more as I discover and use them):  
[ ] [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)  
[ ] [William Fiset - Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms)  
[ ] [My Interview Study Tracker](https://trello.com/b/AjV9XVkL/interview-study-tracker)
